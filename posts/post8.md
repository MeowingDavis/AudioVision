## web audio api 


The Web Audio API involves handling audio operations inside an audio context, and has been designed to allow modular routing. Basic audio operations are performed with audio nodes, which are linked together to form an audio routing graph. Several sources — with different types of channel layout — are supported even within a single context. This modular design provides the flexibility to create complex audio functions with dynamic effects.

### fades

I have a deep appreciation for the creative potential of fades in sound design, and it's easy to overlook their true significance and power. During my studies in spatial sound last semester, I had a profound realisation about the importance of fades. I discovered that fades can go beyond simple transitions between sounds and actually shape and transform them, resulting in the creation of entirely new and unique sonic experiences. This newfound understanding has reinforced the essential role that fades play in sound design, and I continue to recognize their ability to unleash innovative and captivating auditory possibilities.
