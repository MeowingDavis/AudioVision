I would like the game to remain without
weapons, as I had initially proposed, but I
have been considering the idea of implementing
a radio or walkie-talkie that the player can
place to distract the robot, to help further
intensify the gameplay. I have only just begun
to consider this and am not entirely sure how
I would script it just yet, but I think given
the time, it could really enhance the
gameplay.
