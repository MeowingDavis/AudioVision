This application/plugin is based on the PaulStretch algorithm (Paulâ€™s Extreme Time Stretch, originally developed by Nasca Octavian Paul), and specifically the PaulXStretch version from Xenakios. The UI has been updated, adapted for various screen sizes, and built for the latest platforms.

 PaulXStretch is designed for radical transformation of sounds. It is NOT suitable for subtle time or pitch correction. Ambient music and sound design are probably the most suitable use cases. It can turn any audio into hours or days of ambient soundscape, in an amazingly smooth and beautiful way.





## Divergent vs Convergent thinking ##




Divergent thinking involves generating multiple solutions or ideas to a problem or question. It encourages creativity and originality, and is often associated with brainstorming sessions or idea generation exercises. The goal of divergent thinking is to come up with as many ideas or solutions as possible, without necessarily evaluating them for feasibility or practicality at this stage.

Convergent thinking, on the other hand, involves narrowing down multiple ideas or solutions to arrive at the best or most appropriate one. It is a more analytical and critical approach, often involving evaluation, analysis, and decision-making. Convergent thinking is associated with problem-solving and decision-making, and the goal is to arrive at a single correct or optimal solution.







## project things ##

A student by the name of Yanwen Wang AKA liz has said I can do the sound design/sound tracking for her animation based around the affect of coffee on the brain. she will be using music to explore these emotions and said I can have some creative control on how to articulate this.

Aside from this I am experiementing with my friends program called quadbike which is an audio visual program built out of frustration of creating music videos. I will be producing a video with it using music I have made and then i will further sound design on top of this. Im ussure whether I will be completely removing the music that was used to create the video in the first place or leave it in, this will become clearer with experimentation.
