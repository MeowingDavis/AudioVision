Peak-end theory is a psychological principle that suggests people tend to judge an experience based on two key moments: the peak or most intense moment of the experience, and the end of the experience. This theory has been applied to various fields, including sound design.

In sound design, peak-end theory suggests that sound designers should focus on creating a strong peak or climax in their compositions, as well as paying attention to the ending of the sound experience. By creating a strong peak and a memorable ending, sound designers can increase the overall impact and enjoyment of the experience.


Mäkäräinen, M., Kallinen, K., & Järveläinen, H. (2017). Applying peak-end theory in sound design: Investigating the effect of peak sound and sound endings on user experience. Applied Acoustics, 127, 1-8. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apacoust.2017.06.012


In this paper, the authors explore the application of peak-end theory in sound design by conducting a series of experiments in which participants rated their subjective experiences of soundscapes that varied in the intensity of the peak sound and the nature of the sound ending. The results suggest that both the peak sound and the sound ending have significant effects on the perceived pleasantness and interest of the soundscapes, with the most positive ratings being given to soundscapes with a strong peak sound and a positive sound ending.

SoundFont is a file format that allows for the creation and storage of digital audio samples used for MIDI playback. These samples can be used to emulate various instruments or sounds, and are often used in music production software and hardware.


SoundFont was developed by Creative Technology Ltd, a company known for its Sound Blaster line of sound cards. The technology was first introduced in 1991 with the release of the Sound Blaster AWE32 sound card, which included 512KB of onboard memory for storing MIDI samples. This allowed for more realistic and versatile MIDI playback compared to earlier sound cards, which often relied on basic waveform synthesis.

In the following years, Creative continued to develop and improve the SoundFont format, releasing new versions with increased memory capacity and support for more advanced features such as effects processing and modulation. SoundFont quickly became a popular standard for creating and using digital audio samples in MIDI playback, and many other companies and software developers also began supporting the format.

Today, SoundFont remains a widely used and supported format in the music production industry, and has influenced the development of other sample-based formats such as Kontakt and EXS24.

## project things ##

I have reached out to a few students in hopes they'll get back to me sooner rather then later.

Still considering working on my own audio reactive work on the side.
