Peak-end theory is a psychological principle that suggests people tend to judge an experience based on two key moments: the peak or most intense moment of the experience, and the end of the experience. This theory has been applied to various fields, including sound design.

In sound design, peak-end theory suggests that sound designers should focus on creating a strong peak or climax in their compositions, as well as paying attention to the ending of the sound experience. By creating a strong peak and a memorable ending, sound designers can increase the overall impact and enjoyment of the experience.


Mäkäräinen, M., Kallinen, K., & Järveläinen, H. (2017). Applying peak-end theory in sound design: Investigating the effect of peak sound and sound endings on user experience. Applied Acoustics, 127, 1-8. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apacoust.2017.06.012


In this paper, the authors explore the application of peak-end theory in sound design by conducting a series of experiments in which participants rated their subjective experiences of soundscapes that varied in the intensity of the peak sound and the nature of the sound ending. The results suggest that both the peak sound and the sound ending have significant effects on the perceived pleasantness and interest of the soundscapes, with the most positive ratings being given to soundscapes with a strong peak sound and a positive sound ending.

I have reached out to a few students in hopes they'll get back to me sooner rather then later.

Still considering working on my own audio reactive work on the side.
