The random white page thing next to the glass tree will be a random lore intereaction inspired by lucas and his research on data storage on dna.

Once the player goes into the elevator the next level will load into what im calling the server room where there will be a lot of camera and drones to avoid.

I'm yet to really flesh this out but im happy with the mechanics now so i'm able to focus on level design and polishing.
