## expectation compression 

Expectation compression in sound design refers to the deliberate manipulation of auditory expectations to create a desired emotional or cognitive response in the listener. It involves crafting sound elements and arranging them in a way that challenges or subverts the listener's expectations, leading to heightened engagement and an enriched sonic experience.

Expectation compression is based on the principle that our brains constantly make predictions about what we will hear next, based on past experiences and learned patterns. By intentionally deviating from these expectations, sound designers can surprise and captivate listeners, evoking emotions and fostering a deeper connection with the audio content.

## umwelt


Umwelt, a concept by biologist Jakob von Uexk√ºll, refers to an organism's unique subjective experience of the world based on its sensory capabilities and cognitive processes. In the context of sound, umwelt relates to an organism's perception and interpretation of auditory information in its environment. Different organisms have different auditory abilities, shaping their umwelt and influencing how they experience sound. Humans have a broad range of hearing, allowing us to perceive various sounds like music, speech, and environmental noises. Our umwelt is shaped by our ability to distinguish pitches, rhythms, and patterns, as well as language and cultural associations with sounds. Animals like bats use echolocation in the ultrasonic range to navigate and locate prey, forming their umwelt around interpreting echoes. Marine mammals like dolphins have exceptional underwater hearing, using clicks, whistles, and songs for communication, influencing their umwelt for navigation, finding food, and socializing. Umwelt emphasizes that our perception of the world is subjective and influenced by our sensory systems. Understanding an organism's umwelt provides insight into its experience and interaction with the environment, including the role of sound.
