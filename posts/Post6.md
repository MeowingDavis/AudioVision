## Sound motive ##


A sound motif is a sound effect or a combination of sound effects that is linked to a specific character, setting, situation, or idea throughout the film. These sound motifs emotionally prepare the audience for the appearance, arrival, or actions of a particular character. They are particularly useful during the initial stages of film production, where they help to establish the narrative functions of the characters and create a sound association for each character as the story progresses.

Using sound motifs can be helpful in creating a coherent narrative in films that involve multiple characters and locations. It helps to unify the film and maintain its narrative and thematic development.
