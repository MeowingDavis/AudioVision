## Sound motif ##


A sound motif is a sound effect or a combination of sound effects that is linked to a specific character, setting, situation, or idea throughout the film. These sound motifs emotionally prepare the audience for the appearance, arrival, or actions of a particular character. They are particularly useful during the initial stages of film production, where they help to establish the narrative functions of the characters and create a sound association for each character as the story progresses.

Using sound motifs can be helpful in creating a coherent narrative in films that involve multiple characters and locations. It helps to unify the film and maintain its narrative and thematic development.

I spoke to richard about using his program quad bike. He's very keen on my idea and has granted me free access to the program for the duration of the project. He recently made it a paid service and although we are good friends I wasn't sure how keen he'd be but all went as planned when asking him.
