## Projects



Ableton is not letting me automate some of the IEM stereo encoder parameters; it keeps disabling them, and I'm not too sure why. The width parameter is fine, but I was hoping to use that in conjunction with the elevation and azimuth parameters to enhance the visual experience, making it feel like they were moving beyond stereo panning and volume automation. I understand that filtering can be used to create a similar result, but ultimately, I don't think it's going to work as well as I hoped.

Looking forward to some feedback on Wednesday.
