# Characteristic sound / role of sound in film/animation #





The term "natural sound" refers to sounds that occur in the environment without any human interference or manipulation. Examples of natural sounds include the sound of wind, waves crashing on a beach, birds singing, or leaves rustling in the wind. Natural sounds can be relaxing and calming, and are often used in relaxation or meditation practices.

On the other hand, "characteristic sound" refers to sounds that are specific to a particular object or environment. For example, the sound of a car engine or a train whistle are characteristic sounds because they are unique to those particular modes of transportation. Similarly, the sound of a waterfall or a thunderstorm are characteristic sounds of those natural phenomena.

Overall, natural sounds tend to be soothing and calming, while characteristic sounds are more distinctive and can evoke specific emotions or memories.
