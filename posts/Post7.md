I was concerned that my game lacked a story.

I've decided it would be best to have some cutscenes in a slideshow style to give players context and help with engagement. My friend and I have been developing a sci-fi story which has mainly focused on the lore so far. I want DangerLines's story to fit within the same universe as both stories or concepts have very similar ideas.

The year is 2088. Humans have mined Earth to the point of no return. As a result of this, humans live in an altered state of reality known as the Glass City. The Glass City is just a facade, a mere structure of a city, an illusion. Humans are implanted with a chip that augments the reality around them, convincing them of a reality that doesn't really exist.

Individual thought is considered a relic of the past. Information, thought, and sense are fed to us through an AI system known as FLOW. FLOW controls and automates all life within the Glass City. Humans maintain their physical bodies but their minds are caught between the outside.

Due to catastrophic mining, the outside world's weather has become unpredictable. The collapse of the planet is imminent and will come to an end at a moment's notice, but till then, we live in isolation surrounded only by illusions of the digital.

On a particularly stormy night, a strike of immense lightning hits the main database that FLOW operates from. As a result of this, you find yourself gaining consciousness for the first time, finally away from the grasp of FLOW. You awaken in a darkly lit city surrounded by glass pillars. "Where am I?" you think. "What is that sound, that smell... my head hurts." You begin to walk forward...
