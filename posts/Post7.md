I was concerned my game lacked story.

Ive decided it would be best to have some cutscenes in a slide show style to give players context and help with engagment. My friend and I have been developing a sci-fi story which has mainly focused on the lore so far. I want DangerLines story to fit within the same universe as both stories or concepts have very similar ideas.

The year is 2088, Humans have mined earth to the point of no return. As a result of this humans live in an altered state of reality known as the glass city. The Glass city is just a facade a mere stucture of a city, an illusion. Humans are implanted with a chip that augments the reality around them convincing them of a reality that doesnt really exist.

Individual thought is considered a relic of the past, Information, thought and sense is fed to us through an AI system known as FLOW. FLOW controls and automates all life within the glass city. Humans maintain their physicals bodies but there mind in caught between.

On a particulary stormy night a strike of emense lighting hits the main database that FLOW opperates from. As a result of this you find yourself gaining concousness for the first time, finally away from the grasp of flow you awaken in a darkly lit city surround by glass pillars. Where am I you think, what is that sounnd that smell.... my head hurts you begin to walk forward....
