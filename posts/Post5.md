This application/plugin is based on the PaulStretch algorithm (Paulâ€™s Extreme Time Stretch, originally developed by Nasca Octavian Paul), and specifically the PaulXStretch version from Xenakios. The UI has been updated, adapted for various screen sizes, and built for the latest platforms.

 PaulXStretch is designed for radical transformation of sounds. It is NOT suitable for subtle time or pitch correction. Ambient music and sound design are probably the most suitable use cases. It can turn any audio into hours or days of ambient soundscape, in an amazingly smooth and beautiful way.





## Divergent vs Convergent thinking ##




Divergent thinking involves generating multiple solutions or ideas to a problem or question. It encourages creativity and originality, and is often associated with brainstorming sessions or idea generation exercises. The goal of divergent thinking is to come up with as many ideas or solutions as possible, without necessarily evaluating them for feasibility or practicality at this stage.

Convergent thinking, on the other hand, involves narrowing down multiple ideas or solutions to arrive at the best or most appropriate one. It is a more analytical and critical approach, often involving evaluation, analysis, and decision-making. Convergent thinking is associated with problem-solving and decision-making, and the goal is to arrive at a single correct or optimal solution.
