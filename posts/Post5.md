The Apprehension Engine is a custom-built musical instrument designed by Canadian musician Mark Korven in collaboration with Tony Duggan-Smith. The instrument is specifically designed to produce unique and unsettling sounds that are often associated with horror movies and psychological thrillers.

The Apprehension Engine is essentially an acoustic instrument that features a variety of different mechanical parts and resonators. It includes a series of metal rulers that are bowed by hand, strings that are plucked, and other mechanisms that are used to create a range of eerie and discordant sounds.

The instrument is often used in film and television soundtracks to create a sense of unease or tension. It has been used in a number of popular horror movies, including The Witch and The Autopsy of Jane Doe. The Apprehension Engine has also been featured in a number of musical compositions and performances, showcasing its unique and unsettling sonic qualities.

## Curiosity and wonder ##

Curiosity and wonder are related concepts but differ in focus and emotional tone. Curiosity is focused on discovering new information and solving problems, while wonder is focused on the emotional response to something awe-inspiring. Curiosity is characterized by inquisitiveness and may lead to a deeper understanding or improved problem-solving ability, while wonder is characterized by amazement and may lead to appreciation or inspiration. Curiosity can be triggered by a question or problem, while wonder can be triggered by something beautiful or unusual.
