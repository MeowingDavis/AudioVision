### Flow ###

Flow is the AI hinted at in DangerLine's story. It is meant to be the AI that controls thoughts and the overall augmentation.

As a fun interactive feature, I think it would be cool to have Flow as an interaction on the wall for the exhibition. I'm unsure how I will do this yet. I have been experimenting with a local AI from Meta, known as Llama 2, through the terminal. It's not the most powerful or quick AI, but the terminal's aesthetic suits DangerLine.
