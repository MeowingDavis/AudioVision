# Week 1 Audio Vision #


*sometimes the most exciting thing you can do is nothing.. 
This has been mentioned a few times in class and it's starting to stick.
I feel I need to further understand how to enhance the visuals with sound.
I love making music and pretty much anything that makes a sound but I want to further understand the relationship between vision and sound.*

FEEDBACK: An engaging soundtrack which works well with the sound design elements.
As discussed in class, articulating the morphs throughout (the way you started at :31) would have made the experience more compelling. 
Would have been good to bring in more creative references as well as academic resources which speak more directly to the larger idea you're undertaking.
