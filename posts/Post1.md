# Introduction #

DangerLine is a simple yet captivating 3D stealth game where sound and lighting take center stage in guiding players through a heavily surveilled cityscape. Players embark on an auditory journey, following an evolving, drone-like sound that serves as their directional guide.

In this immersive experience, players navigate the city's shadows, mastering the art of stealth and parkour without access to weaponry."The incorporation of parkour in digital games emphasises its capacity to introduce dynamic movement and enhance player interaction with the virtual environment" (Friedrich, 2018). The game-play revolves around utilising the environment and their senses, relying on the ever-evolving sound attempting to avoid detection while progressing through the narrative.

Lighting, plays a secondary role to the intricate sound design, serving to enhance the game-play and atmosphere. The intentional brevity of the game ensures a concentrated, impactful experience, emphasising the importance of sensory immersion and strategic decision-making.

Developed using Unity, DangerLine uses the platform's capabilities to create an interactive, environment that revolves around the nuances of sound.
