FEEDBACK: An engaging soundtrack which works well with the sound design elements.
As discussed in class, articulating the morphs throughout (the way you started at :31) would have made the experience more compelling. 
Would have been good to bring in more creative references as well as academic resources which speak more directly to the larger idea you're undertaking.
