### binaural

Binaural audio is a technique that aims to replicate the way humans perceive sound in a three-dimensional space. It involves capturing audio using specialized microphones or recording techniques that mimic the human ear's natural hearing capabilities. By utilizing two microphones placed strategically to replicate the position of human ears, binaural audio creates an immersive and realistic listening experience, providing a sense of depth, directionality, and spatial awareness. When played back through headphones, binaural audio can transport listeners into a virtual auditory environment, allowing them to perceive sounds as if they were actually present in the recorded space. This technology is particularly effective in applications such as virtual reality experiences, gaming, and audio storytelling, where a lifelike and immersive audio experience is desired.

Stereo to binaural conversion is a technique used to transform stereo audio recordings into binaural audio, which creates a more immersive and realistic listening experience. Stereo audio typically consists of two channels, left and right, which are intended to be played back through speakers placed in front of the listener. However, when listening to stereo audio through headphones, the sound may still feel like it is coming from outside the head rather than from within.




## Projects

### Caffenism draft 11

I'm currently in the process of incorporating feedback from draft 10 and making a few adjustments based on the suggestions provided by liz and peers. In particular, I'm focusing on removing some of the metallic and synth-like sounds to achieve a different sonic direction.

feedback: add sound for when the guy is spitting out his body parts.

### flicker

I'm currently implementing the feedback I received on Canvas and incorporating some of the suggestions from Oliver and Adam. Oliver's suggestion of using sharper transient sounds is resonating with me, as it can add impact and dynamics to the audio. While Adam mentioned chip tune sounds, I want to ensure that the overall aesthetic doesn't become overly video game-like. However, I do plan to incorporate elements of bit reduction to introduce a nostalgic and digital vibe.

To further enhance the immersive experience, I'm exploring the use of binaural plug-ins. I've noticed that certain visuals create the sensation of objects moving towards the viewer, and I want to capitalize on that effect. By implementing binaural processing, I aim to precisely position and move sounds to match the visual movement, creating a more immersive and captivating experience. The idea of traversing through a digital hyperspace has inspired me, and I believe binaural audio can greatly enhance the sensation of being immersed in that digital realm.
