#### flicker


    continuing to work my way through. putting some of the feedback from canvas into action. 
    I like what oliver said about using sharper transient sounds and I understand 
    what adam said about using chip tune sounds but im trying to not have it overly 
    video game like but have incorpirated some bit reduction.
